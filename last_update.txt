## Done till lecture 46

## 2 Applications one for authentication and another to show the catlogue
## Signup == when signup is done the data are saved in the db
## Login == Checks the username and password and logs in (ie: routes us to API "/booklist")
## Add Books == We can add books by giving the required details --> when posting (submit) the data is added to the Book db
               --> and takes us to the "/booklist" when the newly added book can be seen
## added a variable called loginstatus for showing some of the nav bar icons only after login

Errors and Bugs:
## We can go to diffrent api like ("/booklist","/addbook","/home") directly by giving the path (ie: we can get to these pages whithout login when they are directly called)
## Confirm password while signup is not working
## Unable to do the delete operation for books (Assuming that db needs to be imported from catlog_app/__init__ insted of creating on routes.py)
